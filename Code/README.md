## Overview of Files

## Code 
**Analysis and data processing.ipynb**: This is the notebook we used to combine processed data and run machine learning algorithms. You can find a pdf version with the output for each cell in the [pdf files folder](https://github.com/alicezhang09/C3-Grand-Challenge-Submission/tree/main/pdf%20files)

**Examples and twitter data processing.ipynb**: This is where you'll find examples of how to use the functions we've developed, as well as the code for producing all our visualizations. Examples for processing hydrated tweets can also be found here.

**helper_functions.py**: These the helper functions we developed or used, as well as their accompanying documentation. Note that the create_headers and get_rules functions were developed by Twitter and the reshapeTimeseries function was developed by C3.ai. These functions were all publicly available.

**c3aidatalake.py**: These are helper functions developed by C3.ai to make using their API easier.
